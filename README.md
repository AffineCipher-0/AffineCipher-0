I am a recent Cum Laude graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Informatics from Amikom Yogyakarta University, holding a GPA of 3.83. My expertise lies in Networking (Cisco CCNA), IoT and AI development, and database management (SQL). I have a solid portfolio that includes designing remote monitoring systems and have successfully published research on microcontrollers. I am eager to apply my technical skills to drive digitalization and enhance operational efficiency in the industry.
