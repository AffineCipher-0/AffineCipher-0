- 👋 Hi, I’m @Prataka
- 👀 I’m interested in Security Engineer and Network Engineer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PYTHON, JavaScript, C++, HTML, CSS.

Just a script kiddie, who is learning python or other programming language. Want to become an expert in the field of network security and cyber security. But it's not that easy, must have a lot to learn about things about the world of security. Learning is tiring but if serious about it nothing is impossible. Starting to learn from high school about WEB HTML from a very capable teacher. Love what I do now.
In a random moment, you’re inspired by that one amazing idea. And that buzz gets you the endless possibilities that await for you. You know you are going to drop any or all plans and dive into this project with your core energies. And going to be up all day and all night. Sooner or later you definitely going to snap, stop everything and start working on this exciting new idea into reality.
